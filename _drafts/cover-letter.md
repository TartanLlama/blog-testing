(all advice is from the viewpoint of a small-medium sized tech company and all, well, you know, just like, my opinion, man)

A good job application answers two questions: why the candidate is right for the company and why the company is right for the candidate.
The best place to answer these questions is in your cover letter. In fact, with the best cover letters, I even forget to read the CV.

If you can't answer both of these questions on a side of A4, you probably don't know the answers.
Step 1 to writing a good cover letter is to actually write a cover letter. If you don't write one, your CV needs to work 5x as hard for you.
Do *not* copy-paste a generic cover letter. Anyone who has reviewed a bunch can spot them instantly, and they make you look disinterested.
If the job advert lists criteria, reference it. Show why you fulfil (or, even better, exceed) the expectations and provide evidence.
Don't spout vague buzzwords. Every time I read about a "team player who is eager to learn" my eyes roll back in my head so hard I lose them.
If things like being a team player or eager to learn are in the criteria, fine, but (again) provide evidence.
Let your character and enthusiasm show. These don't come across in a CV, so show me who you are and why I should want to work with you.
If the advert asks for links to your work, provide good ones. Many link to a SO profile with two closed questions on std::vector. Don't.
Spellcheck your letter. English might not be your first language, but maeking shoor ur letter doesnt look lyk this can be done by your WP.
That should be obvious, but you'd be surprised. Bad spelling looks lazy. You should put effort into your cover letter, and it should show.
Finally, don't assume you're not good enough. An honest desire to learn the field and evidence that you're trying goes a really long way.
