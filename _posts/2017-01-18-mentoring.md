title:  "Announcing the C++ Edinburgh Mentoring Programme"
categories: social-tech

In my spare time, I am one of the co-organisers of [C++ Edinburgh][cpp-edinburgh-website]. We recently read a [blog post][stephanie-blog] by Stephanie Hurlburt, which compiled a list of software engineers who would be willing to mentor others in a range of software and hardware areas. This gave us the idea to create something similar, though targeted at the Edinburgh C\+\+ community.

## C++ Edinburgh

C\+\+ Edinburgh is a meetup for C\+\+ professionals, students, graduates, hobbyists, and anyone else interested in learning more about the language. It was first started in March 2015 and so far has had 6 successful meetings, featuring a range of interesting talks and a great and growing turnout. We would like to take the opportunity to help our local C\+\+ community by creating a mentoring programme that will bring those looking for guidance together with experienced developers who are willing to share their knowledge.

## Our Goal

Our goal for this programme is to organise social events and hackathons to bring people together in the C\+\+ community, to bring together mentors and mentees and to help people learn and develop their skills. The first stage for this is to compile a public list of C\+\+ software engineers who would be interested in mentoring, and matching them up with mentees. This list is live on the [C\+\+ Edinburgh website][mentor-list].

## Interested in Mentoring?

We are looking to compile a list of local C\+\+ developers in Edinburgh that would be willing to mentor. If you are interested in being on this list, simply get in touch with us either via [this short form][mentor-form], [email][edi-email] or [twitter][edi-twitter]. All we need is a short bio, your area of experience and your contact details. You bio doesn't have to be long, just something to tell people who you are and any skills, knowledge or experience you can share. We appreciate that not everyone would like to be contacted the same way, so let us know what details you would like to be public, and what you’d like us to use to get in touch.

## Looking for a Mentor?

If you are looking for guidance, whether you are a high-school[^1] or university student, a recent graduate, a junior developer still trying to decide your career path, an experienced developer looking to move to something new, or anything else, then get in touch with someone on [this list][mentor-list]. If you’d rather we got in touch with mentors for you, then fill in [this short form][mentee-form], or contact us by [email][edi-email] or [Twitter][edi-twitter]. All we need is a short bio and the areas in which you are interested in being mentored.
