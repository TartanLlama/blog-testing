A quick meta post about some things I'm working on for the blog for those who happen to be interested. Since I'm actually writing a reasonable amount of posts now and they're getting more views than I expected, I bought a custom domain at [tartanllama.xyz](https://tartanllama.xyz). Old links will continue to work, but [tartanllama.github.io](https://tartanllama.github.io) now redirects to the new domain. Apologies if your RSS reader picks up everything as new posts!

I'm currently working on a text templating engine and static website generator in C++17, so at some point soon I'll be rebuilding the site from scratch with my new tools. Although I like the Jekyll theme I'm currently using, I'm going to switch it out for a more bright, minimalistic design, so any recommendations for relevant CSS will be much appreciated!

So watch this space for more developments and let me know if you have any feedback!
